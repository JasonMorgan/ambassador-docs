# This file should be placed in the folder for the version of the product that's meant to be documented. A `/release-notes` page will be automatically generated and populated at build time.
# Note that an entry needs to be added to the `doc-links.yml` file in order to surface the release notes in the table of contents.
#
# The YAML in this file should contain an array of releases (items) with the following attributes:
# - version: The (optional) version number of the release, if applicable.
# - date: The date of the release in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
# - notes: An array of noteworthy changes included in the release. Each note should have the following attributes:
#     - title: A short title of the noteworthy change.
#     - body: Two or three sentences describing the change and why it is noteworthy. This is in rich text format and may contain HTML elements.
#     - image: The URL of an image that visually represents the noteworthy change. This can be an absolute path or the name of the image file placed under the `ambassador-docs/public` folder starting with `./` (e.g., `./ambassador-example.png`).
#     - docs: The path to the documentation page where additional information can be found.
#     - type: The type of change, one of `bugfix`, `feature`, `security` or `change`.
